# Overview

Using Node.js, enter a zipcode and receive the weather forecast data for that area.

The index.js file allows a user to search for weather data (either current or an 8-day forecast) by entering a zip code that is used to extract data from openweathermap.org. The Back-End is working correctly and will be integrated to the Front-End to create a Full-Stack web application on Google Cloud. 

I wanted to learn more JavaScript so that I can better develope websites and applications. Previously, most of my experience was Front-End and I want to be a Full-Stack developer.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
Node.js is used as the interface for the index.js file. In the terminal, I used npm (npm init -y) to build directory needed to upload website. I will use gcloud to upload the Full-Stack web application to the internet.

The functionality is all done with JavaScript. I used the readline library (to get and use the user's input) and the axios library (for the API call to get weather data).

# Future Work

- I am in the process of uploading the program to a website by using Google App Engine.
- Improve the Front-End (add to the HTML and CSS files)
- Improve the Back-End (add more options for the user)
